  <h3>My favorite Avenger is Iron Man aka Tony Stark 
      because I liked his armour suit and ARC Reactor,
      the ARC Reactor was placed in his chest and it helps  
      him by acting as a electromagnetic object ,
       becuse in a kidnab a explosive busted an the
        micro pieces in it whent innside his body.
      And he snaped the infnity stones in Avengers
      Endgame also and there are 3 software systems
      for his armour suit , for his his glasses and for his satlitte,
      Jarvas,Edith,Veronica.
